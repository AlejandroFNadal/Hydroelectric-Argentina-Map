# Hydroelectric-Argentina-Map
A map made with Geopandas and Folium, of every hydroelectric plant in Argentina. You can access it at:

[Renewable Power Plants in Argentina](http://alejandronadal.com/map_renewables.html)

It uses MarkerClusters as layers and these can be disabled and enabled at will. Different sources of energy are shown using different colors. Plants that are not complete are shown as partial circles. 

The legend in the map was made using HTML and CSS.
